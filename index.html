                or more gentle-flowing streams with naturally clean water. In addition to Osun river, there are other relatively smaller rivers
                that tourists will enjoy visiting and fishing from. The riverview is populated with beautiful damsels selling freshly caught and processed fishes 
                of different varieties.

            <h4 class="fact-title">Founders: Iya Olomu and Hunters</h4>
            <p>Historically, Apomu was founded around 16th or 17th century by a prince from Oyo. The prince's wife sells a 
                soup delicacy made from beans, called "Omu" or what's nowadays called "Gbegiri". The woman used to mix the Omu in a big pot.
                The mixing of omu which literally translates to "a po omu" (i.e. the one who mixes omu) serves as the origin of the name Apomu.
                The image above shows the iya olomu and the hunters. The statue can be seen at the centre of the Apomu.
